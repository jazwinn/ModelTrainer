"""
Turning SAM's masks into the outlines a YOLO segmentation label needs.

SAM returns a per-instance bitmap; a YOLO seg label is a single normalised
polygon.  Everything that bridges the two lives here — the live auto-labelling
path, the snap-to-object tool and the offline dataset converter all share it,
so an outline means the same thing wherever it came from.

Nothing in here knows about BBox, which keeps it importable from every layer.
